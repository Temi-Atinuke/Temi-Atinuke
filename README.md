## A finance professional transitioning into the tech industry (DATA ANALYST)

I am a finance professional, an aspiring data analyst with a strong interest in uncovering insights from data and utilizing analytical tools to support data-driven decision-making. 
Currently expanding my knowledge of data analysis techniques, statistical methods, and data visualization, I am focused on developing my skills in SQL, Python, Excel, and other analytical tools.
